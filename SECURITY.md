# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At All Swanky, we take security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you may find.

To report a security vulnerability, please email us at [security@allswankyonline.com](mailto:security@allswankyonline.com) and include detailed information about the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it. Our security team will review your report and respond as quickly as possible.

Please refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it. We encourage you to provide as much information as possible to help us understand and fix the issue.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all aspects of the Swanky project, including but not limited to the codebase, documentation, and related resources.

## Vulnerability Response

Once a vulnerability report is received, our security team will:

- Confirm the issue and its impact.
- Prioritize and assess the severity of the vulnerability.
- Develop and implement necessary fixes or mitigations.
- Communicate with the reporter to keep them informed of the progress.

## Safe Harbor

Swanky project maintains a Safe Harbor policy for security researchers acting in good faith. We will not take legal action against researchers who report security vulnerabilities to us according to this policy.
